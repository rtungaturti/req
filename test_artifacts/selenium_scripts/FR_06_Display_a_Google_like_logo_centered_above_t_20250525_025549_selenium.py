Here is a Python Selenium test script that covers the test cases mentioned:
```python
import unittest

from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
    # Update the path to your ChromeDriver

class TestFR06(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service('/path/to/chromedriver'))
        self.driver.get("https://example.com")  # Replace with your application URL
        self.driver.maximize_window()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.quit()

    def test_centered_logo(self):
        # Verify logo is centered above search box with equal margins
        logo = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".logo")
        search_box = self.driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".search-box")
        self.assertAlmostEqual(
            logo.location['x'] + logo.size['width'] / 2,
            search_box.location['x'] + search_box.size['width'] / 2,
            delta=10
        )

    def test_responsive_logo(self):
        # Test logo on different devices and browsers
        devices = ["iPad", "iPhone", "Chrome"]
        for device in devices:
            self.driver.set_window_size(*device_to_size(device))
            self.test_centered_logo()

    def test_logo_visibility(self):
        # Verify logo is visible and not hidden
        logo = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".logo"))
        )
        self.assertTrue(logo.is_displayed())

    def test_logo_offset(self):
        # Verify logo is not offset to the left or right
        logo = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".logo"))
        )
        search_box = self.driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".search-box")
        self.assertNotAlmostEqual(
            logo.location['x'],
            search_box.location['x'],
            delta=10
    def test_logo_overlap(self):
        # Verify logo does not overlap with search box
        logo = WebDriverWait(self.driver, 10).until(
            EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".logo"))
        )
        search_box = self.driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".search-box")
        self.assertGreater(
            logo.location['y'] + logo.size['height'],
        search_box.location['y']
    )

    def test_missing_logo(self):

        self.driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".logo")

    # Return a tuple of (width, height) for the given device
    devices = {
        "iPad": (1024, 768),
        "iPhone": (375, 667),
        "Chrome": (1920, 1080)
    }
    return devices[device]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
This script assumes a standard web application environment and uses Chrome as the web driver. It covers the positive and negative test cases mentioned in the requirement.

The test cases are as follows:

* `test_centered_logo`: Verifies that the logo is centered above the search box with equal margins.
* `test_responsive_logo`: Tests the logo on different devices and browsers to ensure it remains centered above the search box.
* `test_logo_visibility`: Verifies that the logo is visible and not hidden by any other elements.
* `test_logo_offset`: Verifies that the logo is not offset to the left or right of the search box.
* `test_logo_overlap`: Verifies that the logo does not overlap with the search box.
* `test_missing_logo`: Verifies that the logo is not missing or in a different location on the page.

Note that you'll need to replace the `device_to_size` function with your own implementation, as it's a placeholder. Additionally, you may need to adjust the CSS selectors and the `device_to_size` function to match your application's implementation.
